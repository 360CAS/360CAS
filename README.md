# 360CAS

ThreeSixtyCAS is an open source collision avoidance platform developed to improve site safety.

We are based on an Apache2 license to encourage innovation and open adoption of critical safety systems

360CAS is based on Peer to Peer and Peer to Base communication

The system is composed of a underlying messaging protocol, a vehicle driver situational awareness app and a collision avoidance platform

The 360 Protocal is a messaging protocol and hence is hardware and software agnostic, it can run over any network.

The driver situational awareness apps can take data both directly from the messaging protocol and from the colision avoidance platform. We intend to be independent of VR platform which can range from high end VR to simple low cost coloured strip lights in the vehicle cab.
